						<h1>What is Bringhub?</h1>
						<h3>Discovery through checkout &mdash; all on your site!</h3>
						<p>Bringhub is a universal shopping cart that allows publishers to seamlessly add eCommerce to their content.</p>
						<p>Our easy-to-implement, unobtrusive cart allows your readers to intuitively shop the items in your content.</p>
						<p>Stop sending your audience off-site to make a purchase. With the Bringhub cart, the items you're talking about can be purchased directly on your page.</p>

						<h1>Installing the cart.</h1>
						<h3>Getting the Bringhub cart on your website is super easy.</h3>
						<p>Simply drop a snippet of javascript into your site's header and you're done. The cart is ready to appear wherever you want it.</p>

						<h1>Making my content shopable.</h1>
						<p>Once the cart is installed, making your content shoppable is a breeze.</p>
						<p>The Bringhub publisher interface allows your editors quickly to select which content should trigger the cart, and easily link specific products or product collections to pieces of content.</p>
						<p>It's as simple as copying and pasting a line of automatically-generated code. (Like embedding a YouTube video.)</p>

						<h1>Get paid.</h1>
						<p>Every time a shopper checks out through the Bringhub cart on your site, you earn a piece of the sale.</p>
						<p>Bringhub pays its publisher partners up to 75% of the commission drawn from any sale.</p>

						<p>Furthermore, because the Bringhub cart enjoys much higher conversion rates (consistently over
3% versus ~0.7% for linkout affiliate programs), we're able to negotiate a much larger base
commission from brands and retailers. That means one simple thing:</p>
						<p>For publishers, working with Bringhub is absolutely free. There are no fees or subscriptions, and no exclusivity required. In fact, you can use your current affiliate account through the cart. Boost your affiliate earnings with Bringhub's higher conversion rates and keep your audience on your site.</p>
						<p>In the Bringhub publisher dashboard, you'll have access to robust analytics. See what contenting is converting, how many sales you're making, and which items your audience is buying.</p>

						<h1>The Stores you want.</h1>
						<p>The best brands, top retailers, and premier travel booking and event ticketing providers -- all available in the Bringhub cart.</p>
						<p>If you want to create content about it, Bringhub makes sure you're also able to sell it.</p>
						<p>Fashion, housewares, consumer products, vacations, concerts, and more! If your audience learns about it from you, they should be able to buy it from you -- on your site -- with the click of a button.</p>

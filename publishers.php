						<h1>So, what is Bringhub?</h1>
						<p>Great question. And we've prepared an adorable little comic to address it.</p>

						<h1>I'm still a little fuzzy.<br /> Can you tell me more about what Bringhub <span>is</span>?</h1>
						<p>Bringhub is a revolution that is changing the way people around the world shop. It's changing the way publishers&mdash;like you&mdash;monetize content. </p>
						<p>Your audience can buy multiple products from multiple retailers&mdash;right on your site&mdash;all through a single, secure checkout.</p>
						<p>Bringhub is changing the way retailers interact with publishers and their target consumers. It's collapsing the consumer buy flow funnel. It's giving both publishers and retailers an entirely new revenue stream without disturbing any existing infrastructures</p>
						<h3>Bringhub is the future.</h3>

						<h1>What's Bringhub from a functional standpoint?</h1>
						<p><span class="fancy">Another great question.</span> Bringhub acts as the single checkout for thousands of retailers right in the web's best content&mdash;yours.</p>
						<p>Whether your audience is at home or on the go, Bringhub works with any site, any device, any time.</p>
						<p>Think: A shopper falls in love with a dress featured on her favorite fashion blog. But she also wants to buy the matching shoes and the bracelet (each from a different store). With Bringhub, she can buy all three instantly&mdash;at the moment of discovery&mdash;on the very website where she first found them. Plus, she only has to enter her payment and shipping details once. This means that from here on out, shopping gets even easier.</p>
						<p>Three items, three different stores, and one checkout that keeps your audience on your content. Bringhub isn't just the ultimate streamlined checkout&mdash;it's an entirely reinvented eCommerce experience. One that makes sense for all parties involved&mdash;publishers, retailers and consumers. See? A revolution.</p>

						<h1>How does it work?</h1>
						<p>When a customer makes a purchase through the Bringhub checkout, we securely relay the order details to the corresponding retailer(s) directly. From there, each retailer will process and fulfill the order, and ship the item(s) directly to the customer.</p>
						<p>In the example above, the dress might be shipped by Nordstrom, the shoes by Top Shop, and the bracelet by Noir. The customer only has to enter her checkout information once, so she can quickly make her purchase then get right back to enjoying your content.</p>

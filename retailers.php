						<h1>Do you have an example of how it might work?</h1>
						<h3>Absolutely.</h3>
						<p><span class="highlight">Picture this:</span> A consumer is browsing her favorite fashion blog or media site and falls in love with a look on a featured trend. She likes the dress but she also wants to buy the matching shoes and the bracelet (each from a different store) and gosh wouldn't it be great if she could do that right now right here? With Bringhub, she can buy all three instantly&mdash;at the moment of discovery&mdash;on the very website where she first found them. Plus, she only has to enter her payment and shipping details once. This means that from here on out, shopping gets even easier. Anytime she sees your products on the web, as long as Bringhub is involved, the sale is just a click away.</p>
						<p>That means every piece of content tagged with your products now becomes a new portal to your offerings. Bringhub isn't just the ultimate streamlined checkout&mdash;it's an entirely reinvented eCommerce experience. One that makes sense for all parties involved&mdash;publishers, retailers and consumers. See? A revolution.</p>

						<h1>That can't be right. How do you guys make money then?</h1>
						<p>Glad you asked! We only get paid on commission from sales, so Bringhub only earns when you earn. Furthermore, we give the lion's share of commissions to the publisher (the highest percentage in the industry), so publishers are very motivated to feature products from Bringhub retailers.</p>

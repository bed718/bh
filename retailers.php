						<h1>How it works.</h1>
						<p>When an item is purchased through the Bringhub cart, the order will appear in your eCommerce system as though checkout took place in your actual eStore.</p>
						<p>Bringhub securely funnels orders directly into your existing eCommerce system, allowing you to generate sales and fulfill orders without any changes to your current workflow.</p>
						<p>We work with Braintree (a PayPal company) to automatically split payments. This allows your money to be immediately deposited directly into your preferred banking account.</p>
						<p>Increase your visibility and spread your sales reach beyond the confines of your store's URL. Now, your checkout can truly live wherever your products are seen, so sales happen wherever a customer happens to be!</p>

						<h1>Get paid.</h1>
						<p>The Bringhub universal cart puts your products at your customers' fingertips, making buying
easier than ever. Why risk broken links or chance your customers losing track of the item? Bringhub lets buyers get it as soon as they see it.</p>
						<p>The Bringhub cart enjoys far higher conversion rates than traditional linkout affiliate programs (consistently over 3% versus ~0.7% for linkout affiliate programs). Furthermore, we pay our publisher partners the highest commission in the industry, so sites are more likely to showcase products from Bringhub retailers. This means one simple thing:</p>

						<p>For retailers, working with Bringhub is absolutely free. There are no fees or subscriptions, and no exclusivity required.</p>
						<p>In the Bringhub retailer dashboard, you'll have access to robust analytics. See what items are
selling and which publishers are successfully converting. Valuable data and unique customer insight lets you intelligently tailor your sales strategy.</p>
